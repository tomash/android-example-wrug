Example Android application presented live (written semi-live, i.e. in form of gitorial with explanation during the talk) at 2009-12 WRUG (Warsaw Ruby Users Group) meeting.

You can find the slides from the talk (in polish) at the meeting site ("project homepage").

Basic features, like "Hello World" and (most difficult step when learning Android API) spawning second activity with data exchange and drawing custom shapes.

It is a gitorial with 4 stages, named "stage1", "stage2" etc.
You can figure out the rest with a bit of basic git-fu.

Feel free to use it as a starting point for writing your first Android app.
